# Hi, I’m Dan

I’m an aspiring **Infrastructure / Systems Engineer** focused on building, operating, and automating reliable systems in Linux and AWS environments.

I learn by **building real infrastructure**, breaking it, fixing it, and documenting the results.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On
- Linux system administration
- Networking & load balancing
- High availability & fault tolerance
- Infrastructure automation
- Troubleshooting production-style issues

---

## 🔧 Tools I Use
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, VPC, Security Groups)
- **Web:** Nginx, HAProxy
- **Automation (learning):** Ansible
- **Networking:** TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Monitoring and Alerting (Production Exposure)

- Experience responding to alerts from LibreNMS and Nagios in a production environment
- Familiar with SNMP-based monitoring, host and service health checks, and alert-driven workflows
- Applied monitoring-driven troubleshooting concepts to recovery scenarios documented in this repository

---

## 🚀 Featured Project

### AWS EC2 Load Balancing Lab (HAProxy + Nginx)
- Built a 3-node architecture on AWS EC2 (1x HAProxy LB, 2x Nginx web servers)
- Implemented round-robin balancing + health checks
- Verified automatic failover by taking a backend offline
- Secured access using Security Groups (LB public, web tier restricted)

## 📈 Next Up
- Automate the lab with **Ansible**
- Add monitoring/alerting
- Expand AWS networking (private subnets, NAT, IAM)
